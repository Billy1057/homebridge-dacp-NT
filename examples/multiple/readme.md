# Multiple features example

Multiple features can be configured at the same time for a single remote. This example shows how the [features](../../docs/configuration/features.md) can be used.

Specifically this example:

* Uses a regular HomeKit switch for Play/Pause to make it compatible with Apple Home.
* Disables volume control support
* Disables track skipping

You still need to pair this example to your [iTunes](../../docs/configuration/itunes.md) or [Apple TV](../../docs/configuration/appletv.md).
