# iTunes playlists example

This example shows the configuration of the DACP plugin for iTunes 12.7 with the support of playlists.

You still need to pair this example to your [iTunes](../../docs/configuration/itunes.md) and create a playlist `Test` in your iTunes. See also [playlists](../../docs/configuration/playlists.md) for more information.
