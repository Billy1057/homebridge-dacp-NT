# Apple TV example

This shows a basic homebridge configuration with the DACP plugin for the Apple TV. It also disables the volume control feature as described in [features](../../docs/configuration/features.md).

You still need to pair this example to your [Apple TV](../../docs/configuration/appletv.md).
